Type design (15 minutes)

Design a generic type Stack that
- has a "push" method for adding an element to the top of the stack
- has a "pop" method that removes the topmost element from the stack and returns it
- has an "isEmpty" property that returns true if the stack is empty
- has a "top" property that returns the topmost element in the stack
- can be compared for equality with other stacks (e.g., if stack1 == stack2 ...) if the element type is Equatable
- passes all tests in StackTests (select Exam1 from the dropdown list above, and press Cmd+U to run the tests)
