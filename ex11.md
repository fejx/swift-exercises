# Exercise 11

## Can you inherit from a struct?

No. See [Comparing Classes and Structures](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ClassesAndStructures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH13-ID82)

## How to prevent subclassing?

Make the class `final`.

## Make classes final, or non-final, by default?

Final.

### And why?

Because most often you don't want your classes to be subclassed. Only make classes non-final if subclassing is intended.

## Can a subclass be declared final?

Yes, you can prevent a subclass from being further subclassed by declaring it final.

## A class with no superclass is called ...?

A _base class_.

## What types of members can you override in a subclass?

- designated initializers *(initializers that define all non-optional stored properties of the class)*,
- instance methods,
- type methods,
- instance properties,
- type properties, and
- subscripts

## Can a computed property be declared final?

Yes, you can prevent the computed property from being overridden (by subclasses) in a non-final class.

## Can a virtual method override be declared final?

Yes, you can prevent a virtual method override from being further overridden somewhere down the class hierarchy.
In other words, you can terminate the ability to override at some level in a class hierarchy.

## Can you inadvertently override a superclass method?

No, Swift requires you to explicitly mark overrides with the `override` keyword.

## Can you override type methods?

Yes, you can.
