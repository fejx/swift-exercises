# Exercise 12

*Note*: This was mostly copied from the provided sample solutions, with a few things added.

## Whatâ€™s the responsibility of an initializer?

Setting an initial value for each non-optional stored property in a class or struct.

## What is a designated initializer?

A designated initializer fully initializes all properties introduced by that class and calls an appropriate superclass initializer to continue the initialization process up the superclass chain. The contrary is a convenience initializer, which acts as an alternative initializer that offers different or no parameters at all. A convenience initializer must call a designated initializer in its body though. Also, convenience initializers may be implemented via an extension.

## Can you refer to self in a Swift initializer?

Yes, but only in phase two of two-phase initialization, after all stored properties have been assigned initial values.

## Can you call a virtual method in a Swift initializer? What about other languages?

Yes, but again only in phase two of two-phase initialization.

In C++, on the other hand, you could call a virtual method on an object that's still begin initialized, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

## Why two-phase initialization?

To make initialization safe, i.e., prevent unexpected behavior mentioned above. The second phase of the initialization is reached as soon as all non-optional stored properties have a defined value.

## What is initializer delegation good for?

A class or struct may provide several initializers, each tailored to a certain use case. Swift's initializer delegation rules avoid code duplication, and guarantee that ultimately a designated initializer is called. This means that every initializer **must** either be a designated initializer, or call a designated initializer in its body.

## Do you need to provide an initializer for a struct?

No. Structs automatically receive a memberwise initializer if they do not define any of their own custom initializers.

## Do you need to initialize optional properties?

No, optionals are automatically initialized to `nil`.

## If you use a closure to initialize a property, can you use self inside the closure?

No. Since the closure is called in stage one of initialization, where `self` isn't yet fully initialized, access to `self` is prevented by the compiler.
