# Exercise 7: **Type Design** (5min)

## *struct* or *class*

### XML Parser

**Class**, because neither comparing nor copying XML parsers would not make a lot of sense. The parser's identity is not defined by its current state but rather by the reference that its user has to it.

### Chart in a chart library

**Struct**, because single charts can be copied, moved and compared to each other. If two charts have the exact same values, they would be considered equal, even if they came from different sources.

### Log Message

**Struct**, in the most simple case, log messages are usually just plain Strings, which already are value types. Typically, they would consist of something like:

```swift

enum Severity {
    case .debug
    case .info
    case .warning
    case .error
    case .fatal
}

struct LogMessage {
    let message: String
    let timestamp: Int
    let severity: Severity
}

```

All data members of this data structure are value types. Moreover, comparing by value would make a lot of sense, since two different messages occurring with the exact same message at the exact same time with the exact same severity are *highly unlikely* and would therefore be considered the same message.
